## Implementation Details

### 1. RecyclerView Setup

- The RecyclerView is defined in the `activity_main.xml` layout file.
- Adapter and ViewHolder classes (`SimpleAdapter` and `SimpleViewHolder`) are created to handle data binding.

### 2. Data Model

- A simple data model (`SimpleModel`) is used to represent items in the RecyclerView.

### 3. Data Population

- Data is populated in the `MainActivity` using a list of `SimpleModel` objects.
- The `SimpleAdapter` is responsible for binding the data to the RecyclerView.

### 4. Item Click Handling

- Click handling is demonstrated by showing a toast with the clicked item's name.
